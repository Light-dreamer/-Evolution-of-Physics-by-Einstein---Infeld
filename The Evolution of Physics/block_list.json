Our intention was rather to sketch in broad outline the attempts of the human mind to find a connection between the world of ideas and the world of phenomena. We have tried to show the active forces which compel science to invent ideas corresponding to the reality of our world. But our representation had to be simple. Through the maze of facts and concepts we had to choose some highway which seemed to us most characteristic and significant. Facts and theories not reached by this road had to be omitted. We were forced, by our general aim, to make a definite choice of facts and ideas. The importance of a problem should not be judged by the number of pages devoted to it.

To understand these phenomena it is wise to begin with the simplest possible cases, and proceed gradually to the more complicated ones. Consider a body at rest, where there is no motion at all. To change the position of such a body it is necessary to exert some influence upon it, to push it or lift it, or let other bodies, such as horses or steam engines, act upon it. Our intuitive idea is that motion is connected with the acts of pushing, lifting or pulling. Repeated experience would make us risk the further statement that we must push harder if we wish to move the body faster. It seems natural to conclude that the stronger the action exerted on a body, the greater will be its speed. A four-horse carriage goes faster than a carriage drawn by only two horses.

What happens to the sphere? Three stages of the motion can be distinguished: the initial motion, the action of the force, and the final motion after the force has ceased to act. According to the law of inertia, the velocities before and after the action of the force are both perfectly uniform.

There was also the English brewer Joule who, in his spare time, performed some most important experiments concerning the conservation of energy.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":61,"id":"7ed74a03-4aad-40ac-9f62-d9f9d421492a","page_size":[331,482],"block_position":"61-4"},{"bbox":[34,380,296,419],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":6,"text":"Joule verified by experiment the guess that heat is a form of energy, and determined the rate of exchange.

It exists because this bombardment is not uniform from all sides and cannot be averaged out, owing to its irregular and haphazard character. The observed motion is thus the result of the unobservable one. The behaviour of the big particles reflects in some way that of the molecules, constituting, so to speak, a magnification so high that it becomes visible through the microscope. The irregular and haphazard character of the path of the Brownian particles reflects a similar irregularity in the path of the smaller particles which constitute matter. We can understand, therefore, that a quantitative study of Brownian movement can give us deeper insight into the kinetic theory of matter. It is apparent that the visible Brownian motion depends on the size of the invisible bombarding molecules. There would be no Brownian motion at all if the bombarding molecules did not possess a certain amount of energy or, in other words, if they did not have mass and velocity.

To see whether the mechanical point of view can be applied to the description of electrical phenomena, we must consider the following problem. Two small spheres are given, both with an electric charge, that is, both carrying an excess of one electric fluid. We know that the spheres will either attract or repel each other. But does the force depend only on the distance, and if so, how? The simplest guess seems to be that this force depends on the distance in the same way as gravitational force, which diminishes, say, to one-ninth of its former strength if the distance is made three times as great. The experiments performed by Coulomb showed that this law is really valid. A hundred years after Newton discovered the law of gravitation, Coulomb found a similar dependence of electrical force on distance. The two major differences between Newton's law and Coulomb's law are: gravitational attraction is always present, while electric forces exist only if the bodies possess electric charges. In the gravitational case there is only attraction, but electric forces may either attract or repel.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":90,"id":"9d7f8a81-12ac-4387-a651-642b3bd4c75f","page_size":[331,482],"block_position":"90-1"},{"bbox":[34,327,296,418],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":3,"text":"There arises here the same question which we considered in connection with heat.

Therefore, through the interruption of a current, a magnetic field disappeared. The number of lines of force passing through the surface surrounded by the wire changed very rapidly. But such a rapid change, however it is produced, must create an induced current. What really matters is the change of the magnetic field making the induced current stronger if the change is greater. This consequence is another test for the theory. The disconnection of a current must be accompanied by the appearance of a strong, momentary induced current. Experiment again confirms the prediction. Anyone who has ever disconnected a current must have noticed that a spark appears. This spark reveals the strong potential differences caused by the rapid change of the magnetic field.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":159,"id":"4a2c3202-4b21-4567-a485-ea2a5ed4ecb5","page_size":[331,482],"block_position":"159-2"},{"bbox":[275,34,292,44],"type":"page_number","angle":0,"index":1000000,"text":"147","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":159,"is_discarded":true,"id":"f6309535-3096-4f91-b446-42756f610762","page_size":[331,482],"block_position":"159-3"}],[{"bbox":[88,36,240,44],"type":"header","angle":0,"index":-99998,"text":"THE EVOLUTION OF PHYSICS","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":160,"is_discarded":true,"id":"2fedd75a-0409-49ae-ba87-05bfe1afce4f","page_size":[331,482],"block_position":"160-0"},{"bbox":[33,51,296,168],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":2,"text":"The same process can be looked at from a different point of view, that of energy.

Indeed, it is quite enough to know the results obtained by an observer in one c.s. to know those obtained by an observer in the other.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":178,"id":"5a6f0311-627c-4ac8-bf0b-93eb31c7479a","page_size":[331,482],"block_position":"178-2"},{"bbox":[35,34,52,44],"type":"page_number","angle":0,"index":999999,"text":"166","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":178,"is_discarded":true,"id":"df434fe5-db04-4861-8277-1556937d5af2","page_size":[331,482],"block_position":"178-3"}],[{"bbox":[111,36,215,45],"type":"header","angle":0,"index":-99999,"text":"FIELD, RELATIVITY","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":179,"is_discarded":true,"id":"ec8f8009-017a-49f6-b2b7-b5e63169d992","page_size":[331,482],"block_position":"179-0"},{"bbox":[33,51,297,447],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":2,"text":"Let us consider the problem more abstractly, without ship or train.

The rigid bar represents, in the simple case of rectilinear motion, a c.s. just as did the scale on the tower in Galileo's experiment. It is always simpler and better to think of a c.s. as a rigid bar in the case of rectilinear motion and a rigid scaffold built of parallel and perpendicular rods in the case of arbitrary motion in space, disregarding towers, walls, streets, and the like. Suppose we have, in our simplest case, two c.s., that is, two rigid rods; we draw one above the other and call them respectively the \"upper\" and \"lower\" c.s. We assume that the two c.s. move with a definite velocity relative to each other, so that one slides along the other. It is safe to assume that both rods are of infinite length and have initial points but no end-points. One clock is sufficient for the two c.s., for the time flow is the same for both. When we begin our observation the starting-points of the two rods coincide. The position of a material point is characterized, at this moment, by the same number in both c.s. The material point coincides with a point on the scale on the rod, thus giving us a number determining the position of this material point. But, if the rods move uniformly, relative to each other, the numbers corresponding to the positions will be different after some time, say, one second.

Four definite numbers correspond to every event; a definite event corresponds to any four numbers. Therefore: The world of events forms a four-dimensional continuum. There is nothing mysterious about this, and the last sentence is equally true for classical physics and the relativity theory.

Again, the classical physicist splits the four-dimensional continua into the three-dimensional spaces and the one-dimensional time-continuum.

This means that the stick has the same length for the outside and inside observers, and the result of these two measurements will be the same for them both. Now the observer on the disc measures the radius of the large circle. Placed on the radius, the stick moves, for the outside observer.

Thus three measurements are the same for both observers: two radii and the small circumference. But it is not so with the fourth measurement! The length of the large circumference will be different for the two observers. The stick placed on the circumference in the direction of the motion will now appear contracted to the outside observer, compared to his resting stick.

The probability wave forms the catalogue of our knowledge of the quantum system under consideration and will enable us to answer all sensible statistical questions concerning this system.
